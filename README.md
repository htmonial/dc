Colors for the cluster, ready to be downloaded in A3 format - can also be scaled to the A-series (A0, A1, A2, A3, A4, etc.)

Each member submits one color. I suggest that this happens in the end of each DC meeting. Over time colors accumulate. The colors will always take up an equal amount of space on the paper in horizontal tiles. They organize themselves according to similarity in hue.

Feel free to remix the code and reorganize the colors / data.
